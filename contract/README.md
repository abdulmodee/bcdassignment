Respect the project structure.

1. `ignition/modules` - Write deployment code inside this folder.
2. `test` - Tests go here.
3. `contracts` - Contracts go here.

# Deploying

The purpose of deployment is to use it. It can be deployed to the test net or it can be deployed to the local blockchain the following is the difference:

1. When deploying to the local blockchain, no testnet ETH is required.
2. When deploying to the testnet, testnet ETH is required.

Choose local deployment during the initial phases. Choose testnet deployment when it is meant to be used by actual users. To start the local blockchain run this command:

```
npx hardhat node
```

To deploy locally run:

```
npx hardhat ignition deploy <path/to/script> --network localhost
```

To deploy to a specific network like the scroll sepolia testnet replace `localhost` with `scrollSepolia`.

This is some example output from local deployment.

1. From the terminal where you ran `ignition deploy`.

```
jiahongyap@star contract % npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Election.ts --network localhost

2. From the terminal where you started the local blockchain with `npx hardhat node`.

# Testing

Testing is completely isolated. This means you do not need to have the local blockchain up when testing. To test simply run:

```
npx hardhat test
```

The library used for testing is called [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). I managed to find [this](https://masteringjs.io/mocha) guide as well.
